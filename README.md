# CodeAlpha_IrisClassification
Iris Flower Classification – CodeAlpha Internship This repository contains my completed Iris Flower Classification project developed during my CodeAlpha Data Science Internship. The main goal of this project is to classify iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their physical measurements.  
 Features
Loads and processes the Iris dataset

Data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib

Model training using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Model evaluation using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix

Visual representation of predictions for better understanding

 Tech Stack
Python

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn
